.. DISCLAIMER
-------------------------
I take no resposibility for any data loss or corruption when using this script.
This script will not help in the event of a hard drive crash. If a copy of the
backup has not been stored offline or on another PC. You should copy your backups
offline regularly for best protection.

Happy backing up...



.. INSTALL
-------------------------
Extract the package into a directory. If you are reading this you have probably done
this already.

To install the AutoMariaDBBackup the easy way.
1. Run the install.sh script.
2. Edit the /etc/automariadbbackup/myserver.conf file to customise your settings.
3. See usage section.

To install it manually (the hard way).
1. Create the /etc/automariadbbackup directory.
2. Copy in the automariadbbackup.conf file.
3. Copy the automariadbbackup file to /usr/local/bin and make executable.
4. cp /etc/automariadbbackup/automariadbbackup.conf /etc/automariadbbackup/myserver.conf
5. Edit the /etc/automariadbbackup/myserver.conf file to customise your settings.
6. See usage section.



.. USAGE
-------------------------

AutoMariaDBBackup can be run a number of ways, you can choose which is best for you.

1. Create a script as below called runmariadbbackup using the lines below:

#~~~~ Copy From Below Here ~~~~
#!/bin/sh

/usr/local/bin/automariadbbackup /etc/automariadbbackup/myserver.conf

chown root.root /var/backups/db* -R
find /var/backups/db* -type f -exec chmod 400 {} \;
find /var/backups/db* -type d -exec chmod 700 {} \;

#~~~~~ Copy To Above Here ~~~~

2. Save it to a suitable location or copy it to your /etc/cron.daily folder. 

3. Make it executable, i.e. chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/runmariadbbackup.


The backup can be run from the command line simply by running the following command.

  automariadbbackup /etc/automariadbbackup/myserver.conf

If you don't supply an argument for automariadbbackup, the default configuration
in the program automariadbbackup will be used unless a global file

  CONFIG_configfile="/etc/automariadbbackup/automariadbbackup.conf"

exists.

You can just copy the supplied automariadbbackup.conf as many times as you want
and use for separate configurations, i.e. for example different mariadb servers.


Usage automariadbbackup options -cblh
-c CONFIG_FILE  Specify optional config file.
-b      Use backup method.
-l      List manifest entries.
-h      Show this help.

If you use these options, you have to specify everything according to them and can't
mix the old syntax with the new one. Example:

valid:

  >> automariadbbackup "myconfig.conf"

also valid now:

  >> automariadbbackup -c "myconfig.conf" -b

which is equivalent to

  >> automariadbbackup -bc "myconfig.conf"

or in English: The order of the options doesn't matter, however those options expecting
arguments, have to be placed right before the argument (as seen above).

The option '-l' (List manifest entries) finds all Manifest files in your configuration
directory (you need to specify your optional config file - otherwise a fallback will be
used: global config file -> program internal default options). It then filters from which
databases these are and presents you with a list (you can select more than one!) of them.
Once you have chosen, you will be given a list of Manifest files, from which you choose
again and after that from which you choose differential files. When you have completed
all your selections, a list of selected differential files will be shown. You may then
choose what you want to be done with/to those files. At the moment the options are:
- create full backup out of differential one
- remove the differential backup and its Manifest entry.


.. CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
-------------------------

!! "automariadbbackup" program contains a default configuration that should not be changed:

The global config file which overwrites the default configuration is located here
"/etc/automariadbbackup/automariadbbackup.conf" by default.

Please take a look at the supplied "automariadbbackup.conf" for information about the configuration options.

Default configuration
CONFIG_configfile="/etc/automariadbbackup/automariadbbackup.conf"
CONFIG_backup_dir='/var/backups/db'
CONFIG_do_monthly="01"
CONFIG_do_weekly="5"
CONFIG_rotation_daily=6
CONFIG_rotation_weekly=35
CONFIG_rotation_monthly=150
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_usessl='yes'
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_username='root'
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_password=''
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_host='localhost'
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_socket=''
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_create_database='no'
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_use_separate_dirs='yes'
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_compression='gzip'
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_commcomp='no'
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_latest='no'
CONFIG_mariadb_dump_max_allowed_packet=''
CONFIG_db_names=()
CONFIG_db_month_names=()
CONFIG_db_exclude=( 'information_schema' )
CONFIG_mailcontent='log'
CONFIG_mail_maxattsize=4000
CONFIG_mail_address='root'
CONFIG_encrypt='no'
CONFIG_encrypt_password='password0123'

!! automariadbbackup (the shell program) accepts one parameter, the filename of a configuration file. The entries in there will supersede all others.

Please take a look at the supplied "automariadbbackup.conf" for information about the configuration options.



.. ENCRYPTION
-------------------------

To decrypt run (replace bz2 with gz if using gzip):

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in encrypted_file_name(ex: *.enc.bz2) -out outputfilename.bz2 -pass pass:PASSWORD-USED-TO-ENCRYPT



.. BACKUP ROTATION
-------------------------

Daily Backups are rotated weekly.
Weekly Backups are run on fridays, unless otherwise specified via CONFIG_do_weekly.
Weekly Backups are rotated on a 5 week cycle, unless otherwise specified via CONFIG_rotation_weekly.
Monthly Backups are run on the 1st of the month, unless otherwise specified via CONFIG_do_monthly.
Monthly Backups are rotated on a 5 month cycle, unless otherwise specified via CONFIG_rotation_monthly.

Suggestion: It may be a good idea to copy monthly backups offline or to another server.



.. RESTORING
-------------------------

Firstly you will need to uncompress the backup file and decrypt it if encryption was used (see encryption section).

eg.
gunzip file.gz (or bunzip2 file.bz2)

Next you will need to use the mariadb client to restore the DB from the sql file.

eg.
  mariadb --user=username --pass=password --host=dbserver database < /path/file.sql
or
  mariadb --user=username --pass=password --host=dbserver -e "source /path/file.sql" database

NOTE: Make sure you use "<" and not ">" in the above command because you are piping the file.sql to mariadb and not the other way around.
