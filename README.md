# Font Installation Notes
The most important part of zshbop is the powerlevel10k prompt, which requires a specific font. With Powerline10k you need patched font files. The patch font files are "MesloLGS NF" and are located on the following Github repository.

* https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/blob/master/font.md

## Automatic Font Install
As per the font.md file above.

>Automatic font installation
>If you are using iTerm2 or Termux, `p10k configure` can install the recommended font for you. Simply answer Yes when asked whether to install Meslo Nerd Font.

## Manual Font Install

### macOS
```
cp fonts/* ~/Library/fonts
```

### Windows
N/A

#### Windows Terminal
Then use the ```windows_terminal.json``` in this repository.

#### WSL Script Install - Broken
There is an issue with some of the Powerline fonts I downloaded and installed in windows. So I opted for this set of fonts using a script in a GIST https://gist.github.com/romkatv/aa7a70fe656d8b655e3c324eb10f6a8b

You can simply run this command within WSL

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/romkatv/aa7a70fe656d8b655e3c324eb10f6a8b/raw/install_meslo_wsl.sh)"
```

# Configuration and Customization
You can create a custom configuration file to override zshbop settings and variables. This is useful if you want to use a different plugin manager or override zshbop settings.
## Using zshbop Configuration File
Copy ```.zshbop.config.example``` to ```$HOME/.zshbop.config``` and modify as needed.

### Configuration Options

# Installation Notes
## Operating System Installation Notes
### macOS Installation Notes
Nothing at this time!

### Windows Installation Notes
#### Windows Terminal
Windows Terminal is a means to manage the various terminals installed in Windows.

* WSL
* Command Prompt
* Powershell
* Custom Powershell (Azure + Exchange)

#### WSL Subsystem
You'll need the WSL Subsystem installed.
* Open PowerShell as Administrator and run
```
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

#### WSL 1 vs WSL 2
Open a command prompt on Windows 10 and run the following command to confirm what version of WSL you're running.
```
wsl --list --verbose
```
#### Upgrade WSL 1 to WSL 2
I used this guide https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/164301-how-update-wsl-wsl-2-windows-10-a.html

1.  Upgrade WSL via elevated PowerShell 
    ```dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart```
2. Install VMP via elevated PowerShell. The following enables the Virtual Machine Platform. This is important for WSL 2 for some reason. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq#does-wsl-2-use-hyper-v--will-it-be-available-on-windows-10-home-
    ```dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart```
3. Restart your Computer
4. Set WSL to version 2
    ```wsl --set-default-version 2```
5. Convert your existing linux distro from WSL 1 to 2
    ``` wsl --set-version <distro_name> 2```
Note: If you have an error converting your distro, look at this thread https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4929

#### VcXsrv (WSL Gui)
If you want to run Xserver for a GUI under WSL, this guide will help.

* Borrow or steal https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/tools/upgrade.sh
* Install jq and md5sum via brew for macos
* Figure out FZF wget https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-bin/releases/download/0.17.4/fzf-0.17.4-linux_amd64.tgz
* Look into diff so fancy wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy/master/third_party/build_fatpack/diff-so-fancy
* Add https://github.com/skx/sysadmin-util.git
